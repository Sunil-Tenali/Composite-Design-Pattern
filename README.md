# CompositeDesignPattern

This project demonstrates the Composite Design Pattern, which is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The Composite pattern enables you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

In this project, the Composite pattern is illustrated through a system of gifts. The system consists of single gifts and composite gifts, where a composite gift can contain other gifts (both single and composite). This hierarchical structure allows for flexible management of groups of gifts as if they were single items.
