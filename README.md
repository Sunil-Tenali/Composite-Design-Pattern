# CompositeDesignPattern

This project demonstrates the Composite Design Pattern, which is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. The Composite pattern enables you to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

In this project, the Composite pattern is illustrated through a system of gifts. The system consists of single gifts and composite gifts, where a composite gift can contain other gifts (both single and composite). This hierarchical structure allows for flexible management of groups of gifts as if they were single items.
Real-World Applications: The Composite Design Pattern is applicable in various scenarios such as:

**Real world applications** 
-File Systems: Representing files and directories where both files and directories are treated uniformly.
-Organization Structures: Modeling hierarchies in organizations where employees and departments can be managed as a whole.
-GUI Components: Managing complex UI components where individual components and containers are treated similarly.
